          2017 saw the launch of the Russian Bear #IAmNextSessions, where
          hopeful rappers compete for a chance to win a recording deal with
          South African rap star Kwesta. A through-the-line campaign,
          #IAmNextSessions incorporated a number of touch points, including a
          mobile recording studio, which traveled around South Africa to find
          SAâ€™s next hip-hop superstar. Ultimately, we conceptualised a digital
          strategy suited to the Russian Bear consumer, whose behaviour differs
          substantially from those consumers within the premium alcohol market.
